# Usage
## Installation
From your application directory run: 

```sh
ember install ember-mobile-menu
```

The addon will automatically add the necessary SCSS import to your `app.scss` or (if `ember-cli-sass` is not present) add the required CSS to the vendor bundle.

**NOTE:** the minimum supported Ember version is 4.0.
